# constant

Functions for working with constant values.

When a PENMAN string is parsed to a tree or a graph, constant values
are left as strings or, if the value is missing, as `null`. Penman
nevertheless recognizes four datatypes commonly used in PENMAN data:
integers, floats, strings, and symbols. A fifth type, called a "null"
value, is used when an attribute is missing its target, but aside from
robustness measures it is not a supported datatype.
