# layout

Interpreting trees to graphs and configuring graphs to trees.

In order to serialize graphs into the PENMAN format, a tree-like
layout of the graph must be decided. Deciding a layout includes
choosing the order of the edges from a node and the paths to get to a
node definition (the position in the tree where a node's concept and
edges are specified). For instance, the following graphs for "The dog
barked loudly" have different edge orders on the ``b`` node:

```
(b / bark-01           (b / bark-01
    :ARG0 (d / dog)        :mod (l / loud)
    :mod (l / loud))       :ARG0 (d / dog))
```

With re-entrancies, there are choices about which location of a
re-entrant node gets the full definition with its concept (node
label), etc. For instance, the following graphs for "The dog tried to
bark" have different locations for the definition of the ``d`` node:

```
(t / try-01              (t / try-01
    :ARG0 (d / dog)          :ARG0 d
    :ARG1 (b / bark-01       :ARG1 (b / bark-01
        :ARG0 d))                :ARG0 (d / dog))
```

With inverted edges, there are even more possibilities, such as:

```
(t / try-01                (t / try-01
    :ARG0 (d / dog             :ARG1 (b / bark-01
        :ARG0-of b)                :ARG0 (d / dog
    :ARG1 (b / bark-01))             :ARG0-of t)))
```

This module introduces two epigraphical markers so that a pure graph
parsed from PENMAN can retain information about its tree layout
without altering its graph properties. The first marker type is
`Push`, which is put on a triple to indicate that the triple
introduces a new node context, while the sentinel `POP`
indicates that a triple is at the end of one or more node contexts.
These markers only work if the triples in the graph's data are
ordered. For instance, one of the graphs above (repeated here) has the
following data:

```
PENMAN                 Graph                            Epigraph
(t / try-01            [('t', ':instance', 'try-01'),   :
   :ARG0 (d / dog)      ('t', ':ARG0', 'd'),            : Push('d')
   :ARG1 (b / bark-01   ('d', ':instance', 'dog'),      : POP
      :ARG0 d))         ('t', ':ARG1', 'b'),            : Push('b')
                        ('b', ':instance', 'bark-01'),  :
                        ('b', ':ARG0', 'd')]            : POP
```
